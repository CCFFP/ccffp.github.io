									<a href="images/20240513/2.PNG" class="image"><img src="images/20240513/2.PNG" alt="What the President's Said, What We Know
“I cannot respond to your letter [or demands] because 
I have not had a chance to read it. I will not speak ‘off the cuff,’ because I don’t want to insult you all.”
-President Richardson
*The latest letter (sent the day before the forum) was the faculty’s fifth written letter to the Presidents in a little over a month, in addition to several meetings and other direct actions that have gone unresolved or outright dismissed. 
*Not one meeting has been initiated by Admin in response to faculty concerns.
*What is happening in Gaza, in Palestine, has been going on at least since October.
*Asking our Admin to publicly condemn genocide is not a question of preparation, but of leading with moral integrity."></a>

Sent from the Presidents’ Accounts
“Communication is not something we do well here in Colorado College” -President Richardson
*Yet, communication from the College has been prompt and eager to vilify protesting students. There have already been incidents of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hate on campus, due to the unsafe environment created by Admin against students standing in solidarity with Palestine. 
*How many more deaths will it take for CC Presidents decide it’s time to publicly condemn the horrific and ongoing genocide?"></a>

“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do when I’m getting emails from weird accounts sent by acronyms” -Incoming Interim President Whitaker

We started the CC FFP because many CC Faculty want Justice for Palestine. We speak as a 
collectivity that adds its voice to the urgent nationwide conversation among educators about solidarity with Palestinians. 

All of our letters and demands have been sent from CC accounts. If Whitaker was paying attention, she would know that our 
Open Letter on May 1 was signed by 100 faculty including names, ranks, and departments."></a>

									<h2>Update on May 10th Open Forum - President's Response 5/6</h2>
									<a href="images/20240513/5.PNG" class="image"><img src="images/20240513/5.PNG" alt="Whitaker is Already Done Talking
“I met with a group of students and 3 faculty yesterday and said what I had to say. Now it feels like people just want conflict, not resolutions.”
-Incoming Interim President Whitaker

Whitaker was too frustrated to repeat words that she uttered a day ago to students for the first time (as she agreed to take minor steps towards some of their demands), to a room full of faculty who have their own separate concerns and demands. 

Faculty have sent five unanswered letters and 
participated in several dead-end meetings and protests over a month, but she maligned our requests for further dialogue as seeking conflict. In her frustration, she did not have anything to say about the genocide, or Admin’s next steps."></a>

									<h2>Update on May 10th Open Forum - President's Response 6/6</h2>
									<a href="images/20240513/6.PNG" class="image"><img src="images/20240513/6.PNG" alt="What the Presidents﻿ Would Know about Our Demands, Had They Paid Attention

*The first email expressing our concerns was sent on April 10.
*The letter sent on May 9
was the faculty’s fifth letter.
*We have taken every opportunity to stand by our whole community and call for urgent action.
*Colorado College lacks principled leadership and is out of touch with the majority of its students and faculty. 
*We call on the Presidents to do their jobs and LEAD US. Or at the very least, join us! 

Across several letters, 
we have repeatedly called for:

1 - making public CC investments and divesting from Israel and war profiteering

2 - vacating and/or expunging students conduct records with respect 
to Pro-Palestinian solidarity

3 - a public statement from the college condemning genocide in Palestine and
acknowledging the trauma 
experienced by the whole community

4 - support for informed educational opportunities centering Palestinian scholarship

5 - aligning campus policies and oversight regarding Freedom of Expression, Campus Safety, and Surveillance to our values as an Anti-Racist Institution"></a>
